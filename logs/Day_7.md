## Privacy in dart

Privacy in Dart exists at the library, rather than the class level.

In dart '\_' is used before the variable name to declare it as private. Unlike other programming languages, here private doesn't mean it is available only to the class it is in, private means it is accessible in the file it is in and not accessible to other files.
